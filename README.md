# DP-Delights
# A Dynamic Programming Repository

Welcome to my Dynamic Programming repository! Here, I gather all types of Dynamic Programming questions and solutions to help you master this powerful algorithmic technique.

## About Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, saving the results for future reference. It's particularly useful when the problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you will find:

1. **Question Bank**: A collection of Dynamic Programming questions sourced from Striver's Playlist, LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and more.

2. **Solutions**: Each question will have three optimized approaches:
   - Memoization: Using recursive techniques with memoization to store intermediate results.
   - Tabulation: Iterative bottom-up approach where results are stored in a table.
   - Space Optimization: The most efficient solution with reduced space complexity.

*"Those who can't remember the past, are condemned to repeat it."*

## Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to contribute by adding new questions, providing better solutions, or improving existing ones. Please follow the structure and formatting conventions already established in the repository.
